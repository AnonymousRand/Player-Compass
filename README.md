# Player-Compass

**Version 1.16.1**

# Installation instructions:

1. Click on "Releases" near the right side of the screen
2. Download the jar file from the release you want under the "Assets" tab (unlike with modded clients, you do not need to download the source code zip files; those only provide the code for the mod and not the runnable file itself)
3. Put the jar file into your plugin folder in your server folder
4. Run your server
5. Use /start [targetname] to track the target player

This is a mod made with Spigot NMS and Bukkit API, not a modded client, so the code can be shared as it does not include code from the actual game files.

V1.0 was not documented on this repository and did not automatically give players a compass when they joined or respawned.
